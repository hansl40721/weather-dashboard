This challenge asked us to create a weather dashboard using data receieved from OpenWeather APIs to present users who search for a city
with both current weather data and a 5-day forcast. The challenge required us to use our knowledge of server-side APIs and overall 
skills as frontend developers. Below are links to and screenshots of the deployed application.
